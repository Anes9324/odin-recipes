    <h6>Cheese Burger Recipe</h6>
    <p>I know you know how to make a cheeseburger … but as it turns out, 
        I have some tips you might find useful! From the best beef to the best bun to the best cheese, 
        today’s burger recipe also comes with your choice of burger sauces: a tomato one or my quick creamy Special Burger Sauce. 
        Plus, homemade fries!</p>
    <h2>What you need for a great cheese burger</h2>
    <p>Here is (in my humble opinion) what you need to make a great cheeseburger:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The beef : No need for further explanations</li>
        <li>The cheese ! Processed for authenticity</li>
        <li>The bun : Soft and white</li>
        <li>The green stuff and pickled stuff : lettuce, onion, tomato, pickles</li>
        <li>The sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make a great cheese burger</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Form patties :  Separate the beef into 4 mounds, or 8 if making double cheeseburgers. 
            Gently roll each mound into a ball (not firmly, we want tender patties not rock hard ones!) 
            then press down into a patty that is slightly wider than the burger bun, to factor in cooking shrinkage.
            As noted above, I like using buns that are maximum 10 cm / 4″ wide so the patty is proportionally a good size and thickness. 
            If your buns are much larger, I’d recommend using more beef else you’ll end up with wafer-thin patties, or patties that are way smaller than your buns!</li>
        <li>Cast iron skillet : Preheat oil in a heavy-based cast iron skillet over high heat until it is very, very hot.
            Why a cast-iron skillet? Because it’s made for high heat fast cooking so we can get a great caramelised dark brown crust without overcooking the inside. 
            This burger patty cooks in 3 minutes flat!</li>
        <li>3-minute cook : Place 2 or 4 patties in the skillet (depending how many fit) and cook the first side for 1 1/2 minutes, pressing down LIGHTLY with a spatula. 
            Note the emphasis on “lightly”! Nobody likes dense, hard patties where all the juice has been squeezed out during the cooking phase!</li>
        <li>Flip &amp; cheese : Flip the burgers then immediately top with cheese and cook for another 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Melted : And look at that. A perfectly cooked patty and melted cheese draped over it. A flawless burger!</li>
        <li>Assembling cheese burgers : This is the order in which I like to build burgers because I think it’s the most structurally stable. 
            Anybody who’s bitten into a giant burger only to have a slice of tomato jettisoned out the other end knows exactly what I’m talking about!</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Toast the buns under the grill/broiler for a few minutes until light golden. 
                I only do the cut face because I like to keep the round outside faces soft. Using your BBQ? Just pop them face down straight onto the grill.</li>
            <li>Smear with sauce of choice. In the photo above I’m using my homemade tomato chutney burger sauce and in the video you’ll also see me using my creamy pink 
                Special Burger Sauce. No need to choose – sometimes I use both.</li>
            <li>Lettuce &amp; tomato &amp; patty – I put lettuce down first because it kind of “sticks” to the sauce followed by tomato then the patty (or patties!)</li>
            <li>Gherkins, onion, Next, gherkins are scattered across the cheese (they kind of naturally adhere which is nice) followed by onion. </li>
            <li>Sauce on lid – Finally I also usually smear the sauce on the lid though if I’m feeling extra saucy 
                I’ll spoon additional sauce straight onto the burger stack instead or (gasp shock horror!) as well.</li>
            <li>Jam the lid on top then demolish your burger!</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Et voilà!</li>
    </ol>
